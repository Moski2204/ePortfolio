    "title": "Part 1. Implementation of Dark Mode",
    "description": "1. I implemented the dark mode feature in my ePortfolio by adding a button labeled 'Dark Mode' with the id 'darkModeBtn' to the navigation bar and styled it with CSS to match the ePortfolio's theme (lines 314 & 75 - 86).<br><br> 2. I then used JavaScript to add functionality to the button, by creating an anonymous arrow function that listens for click events. When clicked, the function uses the toggle method to switch between light and dark modes via the dark-mode class (lines 484 - 485) (Step 4). The text inside the button also updates to 'Light Mode' when dark mode is enabled, and then it changes back to 'Dark Mode' when your in light mode. This was done through an if statement (lines 486 - 492).<br><br> 3. I used localStorage to remember if dark mode is enabled or disabled by storing this preference with the setItem method (lines 488 & 491). When the page is refreshed, an if statement checks the saved preference using the getItem method and re-applies dark mode if it was previously enabled (lines 496-499). <br><br> 4. Lastly, to complete the anonymous function from Step 2, I added CSS code. After creating a new dark-mode class in the toggle method (line 485), I added a ''body.dark-mode selector'' to display the dark background on my ePortfolio whenever the button was pressed (lines 31 - 33). The toggle method in my fetch allows the button to switch my ePortfolio between light and dark modes. Furthermore, I also added a new ''body.dark-mode .header'' selector to style the header when it is in dark mode (lines 46 - 48), as well as a ''body.dark-mode #darkModeBtn'' selector to restyle the button and make it stand out in dark mode (lines 89 - 92). <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>See the images below for reference:"

    "title": "Part 2. Implementation of the Dynamic Blog page",
    "description": "1. Initially, I created a blog.html file to display the blog posts. <br><br> 2. Next, I made a posts.json file to store the contents of my blog posts. <br><br> 3. Then, I created a script.js file and implemented a fetch to display the blog posts from posts.json to blog.html. The initial code, provided by my professor, had a few errors, such as the incorrect file path for posts.json. I corrected these issues by adding additional code such as ''postElement.innerHTML'' to insert the JSON data into the blog.html (lines 10 - 14).<br><br> 4. After fetching the JSON data, I added a div with the id ''blog-list'' and a class of ''columns'' to blog.html. ''blog-list'' is referenced in the fetch code (line 2), and the class ''columns'' is used to format the layout of my blog posts (line 99). The ''blog-list'' in the div acts as a container where the blog posts will be inserted. Also, make sure that you've imported script.js in your blog.html. I've imported it just before the closing body tag.<br><br> 5. I then styled my blog posts on my blog.html file by using the class ''columns'' (lines 14 - 18). <br><br> 6. Realizing I wanted better styling, I updated my fetch to include ''postElement.className = 'blogContent' ''; (line 9). This added the ''blogContent'' class to each post, which allowed me to use CSS on the blog.html file to apply the same styles for all posts (lines 21 - 32). <br><br> 7. Next, I added a div with the class ''container'' to blog.html. Inside this div, I included two more div tags: the first div has the class ''Steps'', and the second div has the class ''StepsTwo''. This allowed me to position each of my blog posts inidvidually as I desired (lines 102 - 160). <br><br> 8. Finally, I added CSS rules for the ''container'', ''Steps'', and ''StepsTwo'' classes in my blog.html to style the blog posts and make them look nice (lines 35 - 43, 46 - 54, & 57 - 65). <br><br>See the images below for reference: "
