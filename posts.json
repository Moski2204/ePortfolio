    "description": "1. I implemented the dark mode feature in my ePortfolio by adding a button labeled 'Dark Mode' with the ID 'darkModeBtn' to the navigation bar and styling it with CSS to match the ePortfolio's theme.<br><br> 2. I then used JavaScript to add functionality to the button, by creating an anonymous arrow function that listens for click events. When clicked, the function uses the toggle method to switch between light and dark modes via the dark-mode class (Step 4). The text inside the button also updates to 'Light Mode' when dark mode is enabled, and then it changes back to 'Dark Mode' when your in light mode. This is done through an if statement.<br><br> 3. I used localStorage to remember if dark mode is enabled or disabled by storing this preference with the setItem method. When the page is refreshed, an if statement checks the saved preference and re-applies dark mode if it was previously enabled.<br><br> 4. Lastly, to complete the anonymous function from Step 2, I added CSS code. After creating a new dark-mode class in the toggle method (line 485), I added a body.dark-mode selector to display the dark background on my ePortfolio whenever the button was pressed. The toggle method allows the button to switch my ePortfolio between light and dark modes. Furthermore, I also added a new 'body.dark-mode .header' selector to style the header when it is in dark mode, as well as a 'body.dark-mode #darkModeBtn' selector to restyle the button and make it stand out in dark mode <br><br><br><br> See the images below for reference:"
