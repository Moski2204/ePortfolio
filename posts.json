    "description": "1. I implemented the dark mode feature in my ePortfolio by adding a button labeled 'Dark Mode' with the ID 'darkModeBtn' to the navigation bar and styling it with CSS to match the ePortfolio's theme.<br><br> 2. I then used JavaScript to add functionality to the button, creating an anonymous arrow function that listens for click events. When clicked, the function toggles the 'dark-mode' class on the <body> element to switch between light and dark modes. It also updates the button text to 'Light Mode' when dark mode is enabled, and 'Dark Mode' when light mode is.<br><br> 3. I used localStorage to remember the dark mode state, storing it with the localStorage.setItem method. When the page refreshes, an if statement checks the stored state and applies dark mode if it was previously enabled.<br><br> 4. Lastly, I added new CSS code by creating a new 'body.dark-mode' selector to set a dark background on my ePortfolio when the button is pressed. I also added a new 'body.dark-mode .header' selector to style the header when it is in dark mode. Finally, I introduced a new 'body.dark-mode #darkModeBtn' selector to restyle the button and make it stand out more in dark mode as well.",
